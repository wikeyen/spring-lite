#Spring Lite

This is a project to build up a lite version of spring with IOC and AOP.
The whole development is following the TDD principles.

#Requirements
1. Given an XML file with a bean definition, the program should be able to acquire the bean's definition 
and an instance of the bean.

2. Hide the underlying implementation of creating bean, expose ApplicationContext to the users.
